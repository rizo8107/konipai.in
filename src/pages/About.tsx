          Konipai was founded in 2021 with a simple mission: to create beautiful, functional tote bags 
          that don't compromise on sustainability or style.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-6">
          Our journey began when our founder, Kai, couldn't find a tote bag that was both 
          environmentally friendly and stylish enough for everyday use. After months of research 
          and development, Konipai was born.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Today, we continue to craft each bag with care using organic materials and ethical 
          production methods. We believe that small choices make a big difference, and we're 
          proud to be part of your sustainable lifestyle journey.

            Each Konipai tote is made by skilled artisans who take pride in their craft. 
            We work closely with our production partners to ensure quality at every step.

            From pattern cutting to final stitching, we pay attention to every detail to 
            create bags that are not only beautiful but built to last for years.

            Sustainability isn't just a buzzword for usâ€”it's at the core of everything we do. 
            We source organic cotton from certified suppliers and use low-impact dyes to minimize 
            our environmental footprint.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our packaging is plastic-free and made from recycled materials, because we believe 
            responsibility extends beyond the product itself.
